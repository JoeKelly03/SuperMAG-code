Machine learning of geomagnetic asymmetries: A mathematical decomposition into modes of uncertainty, however this just turned into observing patterns in northern geomagnetic phenomena through unsupervised machine learning. 

Notes for the ML code: All the adjustable parameters and directories are at the bottom with the exception of the directory of the geoplots (ctrl f geoplots) at default you will need a folder called geoplots for the plots to go in. The number of plots you want from each cluster which is on line 712 I was working on picking a monthly piece of code but kmeans shuffles the data so was irrelevant.
